Smog's first ever win!

Here are your player ratings‚Ä¶

Prem

Stopped attacks like Dr Strange at the end of infinity war. Hands everywhere.

11 points.

God knows how many blocks and rebounds.

His best performance in a smog kit.

Monster game - 8.5

Riggs

Like a game of whack-a-mole watching Riggs play.

Pops up in mad places!

One pop up a steal.

Another pop up a basket.

And too many pop ups, he fouled!

Lit up the court

Would have scored a 10 but fouled out.

Monster game - 9

Beallo

Slotted into the back 3 with Prem and Owen and worked hard.

Standing tall.

Boxing out like a security guard at a take that concert.

Monster game - 8

Ronnie

Defended like a monster!

Shot like a monster aswell‚Ä¶ a Tyrannosaurus rex - the one with little arms that couldn‚Äôt shoot for shit

Monster game - 8

Owen

Works his way through the minutes gets up and down.

Defended like a trooper could have scored more from good positions.

Watching him play with Prem was like when I saw Eminem and Rihanna perform live together - wonderful!

Monster game - 8

Ric

Slept in for a 2pm tip

Tried to sneak onto the bench like he hadn‚Äôt slept in and he‚Äôd been sat there since 9am.

Started slow but grew. Some lovely cuts to open Hartlepool up.

Monster game - 8

Mike B

Thought he might shit himself and shell up.

He does that a bit.

But he didn‚Äôt he came in. Bossed it. Getting up and down the court way more than he did 6 weeks ago.

Sank a sweet bucket to extend the smogs lead.

Monster game - 8

Tom S

He saw Ric out.

He got in at 5am on game day.

He wore a geography teachers jumper on the bench.

Came in and was solid picking up the role working his socks off.

Wasn‚Äôt a travel was it?

Monster game - 8

Mike L

Shame for mike he came on when we were on team fouls.

And mike now is always hyped!

Got stuck in.

Covered ground.

Defended hard.

Monster game - 8

Mike and Vince Lam

I‚Äôm doing it again...

2 together

Smoggy had a couple of little Lams.

They ain‚Äôt even related.

They both wear glasses and they are like 2 players that would be on mighty ducks - the type that don‚Äôt have a major part but come in and are mint and everyone loves!

I can see a mad lam T-shirt craze kicking off as the season goes on!

I want one, where can I buy one??

Monster games - 8 each

George

Only got his knees out.

Even if he didn‚Äôt play well he‚Äôd get a 7+ for this.

This is like seeing a blood moon

It only happens every 10 years or something mad!

Anyway aside from the knees, it‚Äôs George ain‚Äôt it

Arms everywhere, fast defence, supports on offence

We f\*cking love George! (And his knees)

Monster game - 8

The Smog crowd
And finally MVP

Filled with the rest of the squad, family, friends we‚Äôve made starting this, mike the bike, speedy and Mr & Mrs Cartlidge. They didn‚Äôt stop cheering, they cheered everything. They kept the players grounded but also spurred them on and totally put Hartlepool off their stride. Only one person clapped when 'pool scored a free throw and that was Ric! He was still sat in Lane 7 at the time and thought he was clapping at a strike!

Until next time Smoggies! üèÄ
