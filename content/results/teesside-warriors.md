Golden Smog Warriors - 33
Teesside Warriors - 39
Here are your smog ratings!
Daniel Riggs- 9
After 6 weeks out with a knee injury Riggs was back!
And he was amazeballs! Busy defence, fast breaks and hitting 3s
There was a scene in there where he was stood looking up at a TW player like when David faced Goliath - we waited for him to get his catapult out and take him down but alas he forced Goliath to turn the ball over with a 5 second count.
Good to have you back Riggs.
Ric Calcina - 8
Started at the top and is a different player when RnR are together.
But tonight our boy Ric played his best ball from the back of the court - dropping into the back 3 no moans and playing his best ball of the night.
Might be the Smog’s James Milner you know..
Martin Beall - 7
Legend has it that every 2 weeks on a Friday when the moon is full old man beall will get a block called as a foul…
Got told off by Riggs for trying to help him fight a giant- he won’t do that again.
Guy Bagne - 7
Fact of the day - Guy walks 32 mile before every game.
He’s getting better every game Guy
In the second half he got a rebound dished it to Ric and ran… I shouted “what the f*ck are you doing Guy!!!” Ric gave him it back… he kept running, his shot was awful but it went to Mike Lam who scored!
“That was f*cking class Guy” I shouted.
Ralph Smith - 7
He’d been to the gym before the game with Riggs apparently
We think gym might be french for strip club
Turned up in a throw over sex top and he had slippy hands through the game
Still played some good D.
Malx - 8
Couldn’t start the game cos no one knew malx second name
We still don’t
Beast on D in the first half he’s improving every single session.
“My surname? Yea it’s Board Beast…. Malx Board Beast.”
Smog rating first
Two players getting scored together!
Mike Loughran & Mike Brown - 7
The fans have pleaded “Get angry boys!”
The lads have answered!!
They’ve both got gum shields!
The Smog have their own bash brothers
We are gonna learn them to shoot 3s and they’ll be the splash bash brothers
(Sounds like a soft core 70s vid)
Amy Neville - 7.5
First game for the Smog
Hit a 3
Came on was calm played ball
Played well with Emily
She’s quiet Amy
We’ll find something funny to write next time!
Emily Robinson - 7
Talk about pressure!
As if the first game wasn’t bad enough Emily brought her wife to this one!
And to be fair played great
Bit more confidence even had a bit of a dribble a couple of times!
Tom Squires - 7
Came on and played his part where needed.
You know we are doing well cos you can hear him cheering. I was stood in the Spar near monkey tree park getting some Doritos and I heard him - he was in Queens
“Sh\*t! The games started.. but we are doing well I thought..”
Mike Lam - 7
First game for Mike
He was also playing in front of his watching partner.
Went on and was more Nervous than me watch the first bit on scream - you know where she’s making popcorn? - that bit.
Anyhow when he came off he was told to chill out and play the game he does at sessions there’s no ghost face here.
Went back in scored and played ball
He’s only going to get better.
Adam Waller - Coach - 7.5
Master stroke moving Ric into the back 3
Came on and scored a 3
Then he came back on to stop the fouling and did a foul straight away
Forgot the balls
Doesn’t know what day of the week it is
Had a new haircut.
Special thanks to our 2 new fans!
Smog lost by 6
For the last 2 mins every foul was a free throw to TW
Played unreal
Squad taking shape as we lead up to the Durham league starting.
Let’s go Warriors!!
