Think we lost by 12
Not sure.
Done care.
Game was a mad one.
3 players playing their first game.
We’ve played 4 or 5 games in this league improving every time but it turns out the league only started last week
Didn’t know…
So onto the player ratings..
Ronnie bowman - 9
Apparently George knows Ronnie
He says ohh I’m over 30 loads
He’s quick
He can handle the ball
He was MVP in his first game
Not many Ronnie’s about now a days - happy to have him
He wore beall 10 cos his kit is in the post
Best beall 10 has ever played.
Boomer - 7
First game
Didn’t play a lot but when he did didn’t look out of place - 4 weeks ago boom was taking shots like I toss pancakes
He doesn’t do that anymore
Few more months and he can be a player
Vincent - 8.5
Vincent.
The last cool as f*ck person called Vincent I knew was in beauty and the beast back in the 90s
Our Vincent is cooler
A midgies dick off MIP
He’s cool as ice
Controls the ball
Makes the right pass
Likes a beer
Vincent.
Martin beall - 7
Old as fuck
Needs a hair cut
Gets put in when things needs to chill
Needs to grab instead of slap
Technically MVP cos Ron wore his top
He’ll take that..
Malx - 7.5
Malx is fucking mad - didn’t even blank a letter out there
He drives from france or somewhere
Turns up
Grabs more than a contestant on supermarket sweep
Top smoggie
Ralph smith - 7.5
Played first half
Let his man slide loads
Got told don’t do it again at half time
Didn’t do it
Went beast mode on offence
Ran out of steam
He’s Ralph - our Ralph
Tom squires - 7.5
Carrying a cold it wasn’t rona he’d had like 4 tests
Didn’t even notice his ankle socks
Got inside loads
2 baskets - that’s one more than Moses
Probably his best game.
Amy Neville - 8.6
F*ck knows where amy come from
Message to the smog one day and she appeared
She will go toe to toe with anyone
She can play ball
Steps in against big blokes and honestly doesn’t care
Would be class if we could have aims in the durham league squad.
Likes a kasteel.
Mike Brown - 7
I just want more from mike b
He’s like that lad at the end of love actually that meets that lass and runs through the airport
I want mike to run through the airport
He can be beast mode mike
He’s a smog fave
He can own the paint
Come on mike, let’s have ya.
Adam Waller - coach - 7.5
He had a sleep parting
He always has a sleep parting
He’s so laid back he’s pretty much asleep
But he sees shit no one else does
Told Ralph at half time
Ralph changed
Came in and played where needed
He’s class.
Jack buckle - 7
First game
Was shitting himself
Didn’t need too
He played well
He’s joined he fits in well
He’s a good lad
Solid debut.
Programme notes:
Our boy Riggs turned up to watch half way through
He’s got a new scooter
Only fell off it on the roundabout
All our team stopped and got our boy Riggs sorted
This is what I’m most proud about tonight.
Top group of people.
Riggs is alright by the way.
TEAM. Ten out of Ten
