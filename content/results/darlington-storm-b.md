Player ratings

The crowd was class again.

Great to see Howard from Basketball England there who has backed us right through the process of setting up this team.

Same can be said of Steve Butler who again came and watched and has been so helpful to get us to where we are now.

Great to see local teams supporting each other! And the Smoggies!

Still there clapping, cheering in the cold and snow! Amazing!

Addie Abbott – 8

Debut!
Opened the scoring for the Smog.
So good at getting inside.
Hadn't played competitive basketball for years – it didn’t show.
When he wasn’t playing he wore a mustard coloured jumper the style of which you would normally see being worn by miss Hooley in Balamory on cbeebies.

Owen Waddington – 7

He just silently mills through games does our O.
Does everything tidy.
Probably his most quiet game.

Ric Calcina - 8.5

Ric's best performance in a smog kit.
Scored well again.
Defended excellently.
And played the right pass at the right time.
He also invented the word Premilicious!

Chris Emmerson – 8.5

Debut!
Could have played anywhere this season Chris.
Chose the Smog!
His shot is fire!
And he really grafted on D as well.
Had a few loose shots late on but was carrying an injury so we'll let it ride.

Malx – 7

Debut!
Malx got sent in with the instruction to quieten down the best player on the court.
He did just that hitting Emmerson on a rebound scuffle and turning his ankle!
We meant their best player Malx mate!
Outside of that came in and was solid under the net grabbing rebounds and getting some good chances under their net – when these start dropping he'll be a right handful!

Mike Lam – 7

Again, that pairing with Vince was ace.
Only found out yesterday that before this team started, they hadn’t played together!
They play together like they’ve been doing it for years.
Always know where each other is.
Only thing Mike can do to push his score up is take the shot sometimes when open.
He went in late without Vince – thought he might run about shouting where's my Vince! He didn’t, he played well and seen out the game.

Vince Lam – 7.5

Likes a beer our Vince
And it's not any of this 4% crap
Vince goes big! Straight on the 9% beers after the game.
Went big in the game as well – cool as ice on the ball, weighed in with points.
Gets the ball moving.
Fits in great with the team.

Prem – 8

Pulled a Ric this week – rocked up late.
But did it in style – he's grew the best 70s detective tash ever in the last 2 days
He looked like a member of the village people – we didn’t know whether to get him on the court to play or keep him for halftime and get him to do YMCA with the Smoggies watching.
Anyhow we ended up going with letting him play – he went in and bossed it AGAIN.
Premilicious!

Martin Beall – 7

Got put in at halftime to stop Storm's bigs from getting joy in the paint – did it.
Can't go wrong if you do what’s asked when on the court.

Tom Squires – 7.5

Same instruction as what was given to Martin – and carried it out.
Kept the paint clean.
He’s really benefited from hitting every session – gets up and down way more.
Should have had at least 1 from the free throw line.

Mike Brown - 7

Came in at the centre and was like a wall.
Just needs to watch them guys running past and shift to cut the line.
Way more mobile than he was a few months ago – again never misses a session and it's really paying off.

Ronnie Bowman – 7.5

As busy as ever.
A lot of the points he gets are fast breaks caused by high D.
He adds loads on D and is always on the move.
A few daft fouls were the only downside to another solid performance.
