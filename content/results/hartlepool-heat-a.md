Player ratings
Ric calcina - 10
Late again
Few loose passes
But keeps going and does it with a smile on his face
Should have been playing at this level years ago

Ronnie Bowman - 10
Martin wasn’t gonna cut his hair until Ron hit a 3
It was taking too long so he got it cut on Saturday
Ron hit the 3 Sunday!
Always busy - never stops

Chris Emmerson - 10
Teams fear Chris
“Shooter left”
“Shooter right”
He worries them
Which mean others get left - big mistake!
Carrying an ankle injury, wasn’t at his best but still worked hard.

Prem Varghese - 10
He’s still got the tash all!!
He’s class Prem we loves him
Apart from when he gets fouled out
Then we miss him!

Martin Beall - 10
Again sent in to slow down their offence
It was working until he picked up a dead leg
Had to leave the court and couldn’t come back on
He’s still walking like the baddie off Men in Black now.

Owen Waddington - 10
Still needs a bit of composure under the net on offence but when that comes he’s gonna be a proper player.
Came in when needed played steady.

Malx - 10
Once Malx gets more game experience he’s gonna be off it. It’s coming.
You watch.

Addie Abbott - 10
More game experience
Getting stronger and stronger
The extra practise now will do him good
He’ll be better when the league starts again next year.

Daniel Rigobert - 15
Wow
31 points
Took the piss
He’d gone home for Christmas
Was missing his team
So train back Saturday
Game Sunday
Back to London Tuesday!
And in between this performance!
It’s like watching Rocky 4
Small guy taking on big lads - shouldn’t do what he’s doing but does. He’s magic when he plays like this.

We need a player called Adrian so he can shout it at the end!
Any Adrians looking for a team?

Mike Lam - 11, Tom Squires - 11 and Vince Lam - 11
These 3 make me happy
They didn’t play a minute, not even a second
But they didn’t stop cheering and clapping pushing the team on
Passionate!

And finally the crowd

Wow.

Mostly people that go to a pub and like beer.
They’ve got behind this team with all their heart.
They make noise, they cheer and clap none stop.
(And they drink tea and coffee like it’s going out of fashion!)
Much love x

So that’s a wrap on the durham league front until 2022.

If we had been visited by the ghost of Christmas future this time last year and they said “Hey Ebenezer Smog this time next year your diverse, all age, all background basketball community team would be 2 league games unbeaten” we’d have said “ yeah yeah ghost of Christmas future stop talking sh\*t mate” but here we are!

Amazing.
