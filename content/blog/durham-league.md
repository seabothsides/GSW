## 20 Players registered for our first season

A year ago some amazing Smoggies formed a pub basketball team - Golden Smog Warriors Basketball

They expected to have a handful of players but really hoped for ten so they could have a game.

They made the sessions open - just come when you can.

Everyones first session free then it's pay what you play.

Everyone and anyone over 18 is welcome, come along meet new people & keep fit.

The Warriors got more people than they ever thought.

They played in a recreational league allowing new players to play competitive basketball.

They play ball.

They have a laugh.

They have helped in the local community.

They socialise together #team

They got better.

The numbers got bigger.

The Warriors got stronger.

And.....

We have well and truly smashed every goal we had and now have a 20 player squad and have a strong team heading into the season.

As always with us the main objective for us is to have fun and give our players the chance to play competitive basketball.

## Durham League to Get Underway

After some confusion and moving around behind the scenes with the Durham County Basketball Association the season is now ready to begin.

A Lack of refs and table officials has been the main delay in getting started.

With our first season dealing with any of this we are looking forward to getting underway and will begin player registrations in the coming days!

## First Durham League Game vs Hartlepool Heat B

The Golden Smog Warriors play their very first game in the Durham League - AMAZING!

We are so, so proud of them all, genuinely decent people who make The Smog even better

itâ€™s a big deal
