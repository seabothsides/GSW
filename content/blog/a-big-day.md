Sunday 1st August is a MASSIVE day for everyone at Golden Smog Warriors.


Six weeks ago we heard about a campaign to raise funds for a memorial to remember local men that volunteered to fight fascism in the Spanish Civil War between 1936-1939.

As an inclusive & proudly anti-fascist community basketball club, we wanted to be part of it and do all we could to remember these eight local heroes.

But.....what could we do?

A brand new ramshackle basketball team.....based in a pub!

Well, what we did was release a â€˜Limited Editionâ€™ Golden Smog Warriors kit with all profits donated to the campaign.

It looked mint and I remember thinking we might even get to double figures.....well, ten of the Warriors had said they'd buy one so seemed a good bet!

We launched it with Baseline, Leeds and we have sold close to SIXTY! 60!!!

The kits are currently shipping all over the globe.

We were absolutely overwhelmed with the interest in the memorial and the kit, the generous donations and good wishes so a HUGE thank you to every single person who shared the information, bought a kit or a top or spread the word.

Another local team contacted us to see if they could help and we thought- yes you can - LET'S PLAY BASKETBALL!

So, we arranged a competition with a trophy named in honour of Otto Estensen, one of the Stockton Briagders

Four teams on board!

Sell out fifty people capacity!

This Sunday!

Stocktonâ€™s first ever Otto Estensen Trophy basketball play off will take place and we couldn't be more chuffed.

Watch this space for updates, videos, photos and loads more from the day.

From every Golden Smog Warrior, thank you to everyone, in Teesside and all over the world, for your genrous and genuine support ðŸ˜Š

Itâ€™s great to see the Golden Smog Warrior community growing every day with like minded, kind and, let's face it, cool Warriors around the world.

Â¡No Pasaran! âœŠ
