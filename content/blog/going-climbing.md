One of the good things about being the country’s only micropub team is that we meet some class people while we’re having our post-match pints in the Smog.

Last week, one of the Smog’s regulars - Mike - led us on a team-building trip to a little spot in the country so a few of us could have a bash at hauling ourselves up some rocks.

We got our outside clothes on - joggers and trackies for most, jeans for Martin. We’re not gonna lie, for some of us it was a slog even to get up the hill to where the rocks would be. Then we started climbing.

Some of us flew up. Ric, Amy and Prem showed off their Spiderman skills. Waller showed good promise too, mastering one of the routes on his second attempt by throwing his legs as wide as they would take him.

A couple were more timid but gave it a go anyway. We did our best and cheered each other on all the way.

To finish up we helped each other up and got the whole team to the top of the rock. A class team effort that involved leg-ups, hand-ups, shoulder-ups, and - in poor Prem’s case - head-ups too.

Off to the Smog for a pint with Mike after. We had a class time sharing the answers from Mike’s getting to know you activity and then spent the rest of the week trying to get our legs, shoulders, arms and everything else back into action for our first match in the Durham league.
