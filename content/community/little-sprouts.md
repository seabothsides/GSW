Since April this year we have supported Little Sprouts within their Holiday Activity days giving the chance for children to engage and learn through healthy physical activity.

We've had a blast this year getting different children every time wanting to have a go at playing basketball.

This is what its about getting involved in the local community and letting people that wouldn't otherwise have to chance to play basketball the oppurtunity.

The work little Sprouts do is great! We look forward to working with them every chance we get.
